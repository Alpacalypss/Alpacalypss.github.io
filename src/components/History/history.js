      <h1 className="historyTitle">A Brief Overview Of Me</h1>
      <span className="historyMe">
        For most of my life I have bounced around from hobby to hobby. My
        hobbies include, landscaping, skateboarding, cooking, gymnastics,
        rockclimbing, fire spinning, and gaming, as well as many others. My
        favorite thing in the world is constantly being able to learn and expand
        on things I already know. During and right out of highschool I began
        going to the University of Oregon focusing on three majors: Physics,
        Math, and Engineering. I was enjoying the schooling aspect of it, but
        the further I got, the more unsure I felt about commiting myself to
        typical engineering as a career. I was left with a choice, between going
        into debt to finish my degree in something I was no longer feeling
        positively about, or get a job and try something new. I chose the
        latter, and at 19 started working as a dishwasher for a restaurant
        called McMenamins Northbank. Within a year of starting there, I was
        promoted into management, as the youngest manager in company history. I
        loved working there and learned so many invaluable skills, but as time
        went on I started to feel the complacency set in. I was no longer
        learning new skills, and really missed getting to use my brain
        creatively to solve problems like I did in school. I knew I did not want
        to continue pursuing my physics/engineering degree, so I decided to
        check out computer science, and software engineering. I immediately was
        in love with the field. All of the sudden I went from bored, to seeing
        something with endless possibilities that I could spend the rest of my
        life learning and never truly master all aspects of.
